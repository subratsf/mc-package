title: Register Endpoint for Custom Content Block Component
---

Once you know the hosted endpoint for your custom content block UI, you must register that endpoint in a Marketing Cloud installed package.
>To add content blocks to an existing Marketing Cloud app, add them as components in the same package.

1. [Create an installed package](install-packages.htm) or navigate to an existing package.
2. Under Components, click **Add Component**.
3. Select **Custom Content Block**.
4. Type a **Name** and **Description** for the content block. This name doesn't display in Content Builder.
6. Enter the **Endpoint URL**, which is the base URL for your block widget. Content Builder loads all assets relative to this endpoint.
7. To complete registration, save the component.
