Using the Marketing Cloud platform, you can call the public Marketing Cloud API, create a mobile app that integrates with Marketing Cloud, or build custom apps and components on top of Marketing Cloud.

##Marketing Cloud Packages
A package is your starting point for all developer activity. Create packages to connect to the API. You can also extend Marketing Cloud with packages containing custom apps or custom Journey Builder activities and events. Your organization or business partners build these customizations, or they are installed from AppExchange.

##APIs
The Marketing Cloud offers a REST and SOAP API that share a common authentication mechanism based on OAuth 2. Use these APIs to interact with the following Marketing Cloud functionality.

* Tracking
* Subscribers and lists
* Programs
* Triggered sends
* Content
* Contacts
* Journey Builder
* Mobile Connect
* MobilePush
* Campaigns

##SDKs
The Marketing Cloud SDKs provide a cross-functional framework around the REST and SOAP APIs that allow developers to integrate APIs using native language code libraries. We also provide SDKs for iOS and Android to use with MobilePush.

##Programmatic Languages
The Marketing Cloud offers custom scripting languages to personalize landing pages, create applications, construct cross-channel templates or layouts, and work with messaging functions on the Marketing Cloud platform.
