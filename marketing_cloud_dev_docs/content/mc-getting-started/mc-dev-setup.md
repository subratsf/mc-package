title: Set Up Your Development Environment for Legacy Packages
---
1. [Install a Package](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.mc-app-development.meta/mc-app-development/install-packages.htm)
Create an installed package in your Marketing Cloud account to create API integrations, install custom apps, or add custom Journey Builder components.
2. [Get a Client ID and Secret](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.mc-app-development.meta/mc-app-development/api-integration.htm)
To use the Marketing Cloud API, create an API integration. Creating an API integration gets you a client ID and secret.
3. [Get an Access Token](get-access-token.htm)
Use your client ID and secret credentials to get an OAuth access token directly from the requestToken API authentication service. Use the access token to authenticate subsequent calls.
