title: Data Extension Functions
---

The Function object allows you to use the associated methods to work with data extensions inside your Marketing Cloud account. You can use this object to add, edit, or delete information from these data extensions. For example, you can search for a ZIP code and pull back corresponding information, such as city name or closest store location, to include in a message or landing page.
