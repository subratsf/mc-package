Platform Server-side JavaScript functions allow you to use standard JSON and JavaScript functionality to interact with the Marketing Cloud platform. Platform objects can function within email messages, mobile messages, CloudPages, microsites, and landing pages. Because platform objects exist outside of the core library, you can realize faster performance than with other Server-side JavaScript functions.
