title: AMPscript Variable Functions
---

The Variable object retrieves values from declared AMPscript variable in the JavaScript context, allowing you to use both languages as necessary for your activities. All variables must follow the AMPscript variable-naming syntax. Variable server-side JavaScript functions will add a @ prefix to any variable that does not include that prefix. These functions can only work with AMPscript variables in the current context.
