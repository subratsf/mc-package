title: If
---

The if block helper conditionally renders content based on the value of the expression. When the expression contains a true, non-null, non-undefined, non-empty value, the block helper renders the specified content. Include an optional else tag as needed:

The above example renders "Your order is ready" in applicable email messages and "Your order is not ready" for all other email messages.
