title: Get Started with AMPscript
---

##Prerequisites

This feature requires basic information related to general logic and AMPscript in specific. AMPscript is not a full-fledged object-oriented programming language like C++, C#, or Java, but you do need to familiarize yourself with some programming concepts to make full use of all available AMPscript features.

##Scenario

Northern Trail Outfitters maintains a monthly newsletter distributed to previous customers. Their mailing list contains the following information on these customers:

* A unique customer ID number
* First Name
* Last Name
* Preferred Name
* Street Address
* City
* State
* ZIP Code
* Email Address

##Preferences

The monthly newsletter contains updates about the company as well as content tailored specifically for the customer. As new items come in and different sales are announced, the customer receives a customized email including content targeted to their particular interest. Links in the email send the customer to a landing page that features items they might be interested in and incentives to encourage a purchase. The customer can also forward these offers to their friends and family, encouraging more sales and gathering more information about the customer for Northern Trail Outfitters to use in their marketing campaigns.

## AMPscript 101-401

These articles demonstrate how to manage the example mailing list and use it in different email sends with progressively advanced AMPscript examples. Review the information in each section and use it in your own AMPscript code.

* AMPscript 101 - This article demonstrates how to create variables and use them to set values in data extensions and print those values to the screen.
* AMPscript 201 - This article uses an if/else statement to insert a customer's preferred name and uses AMPscript to insert dynamic content and an estimated shipping date.
* AMPscript 301 - This article adds a content lookup based on a unique row in a data extension and populates multiple fields with content based on that row. The article also uses error checking to account for any unexpected data.
* AMPscript 401 - This article introduces FOR loops as part of an email send. It also demonstrates how to use AMPscript to change the appearance of an email send, filter message context, and create content from blocks of code.
