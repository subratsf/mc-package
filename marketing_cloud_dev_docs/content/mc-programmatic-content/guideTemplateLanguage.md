Guide Template Language (Guide or GTL) provides a declarative syntax used for creating personalized, dynamic, data-driven messages. Construct templates for use across channels and layouts. Guide Template Language leverages the widely adopted Handlebars and Mustache template languages and provides additional functionality. Guide Template Language simplifies how users interact with content and data and helps them quickly build personalized Journey messages.  Typical users include designers, developers, and technical marketers involving sophisticated content use cases.

Guide Template Language permits parsing of JSON objects contained in data extension columns. For example, you can construct a JSON object made up of fields from a data extension and use that object to populate multiple sections of an email message or web page.

* Section tags filter by relationship
* Dataobject tags use the filter defined in the data section
* Datasource tags use the filter defined in the data section
