title: Use Server-Side JavaScript with AMPscript
---

Review the Server-side JavaScript Syntax Guide before reviewing associated page. You must be familiar with both AMPscript and server-side JavaScript before using the information in this document. While you can use AMPscript and JavaScript together, we do not encourage this as a best practice. This guide helps those with old AMPscript code make that code work in conjunction with server-side JavaScript as necessary. If you begin a landing page, you should use either server-side JavaScript or AMPscript for your project.
