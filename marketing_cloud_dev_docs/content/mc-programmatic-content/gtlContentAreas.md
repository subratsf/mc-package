Guide Template Language uses slots and blocks as containers for content areas within templates and layouts. Review this information to use these containers within your markup.

## Sample Template

This sample demonstrates how to include templates within an HTML email:

<gist data-gist="https://gist.github.com/ryanwilliamsET/41030f7fd314f4a05f5aed50456ae5b9.js"></gist>

The rendered email appears as displayed:

<img src="images/rendergtl.png" alt="Screenshot of rendered email" class="img-responsive" style="margin: 25px 0;" />
