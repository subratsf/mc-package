title: Get Started with the Python SDK
---
##Installation

[Download the Python SDK from GitHub.](https://github.com/salesforcefuel/FuelSDK-Python) Make sure you install all dependencies as described in the SDKâ€™s README.

##Use

Once the SDK is configured, initialize it by instantiating an <samp class="codeph nolang">ET_Client</samp> object:

```python
import ET_Client
client = ET_Client.ET_Client(False, False)
```

The <samp class="codeph nolang">ET_Client</samp> object is the central object in the SDK and performs a number of tasks for you automatically, including acquiring and refreshing OAuth access tokens using the client credentials you specified in the last step.

Once the SDK is initialized, you can use it to programmatically interact with the account represented by the <samp class="codeph nolang">ET_Client</samp> instance. Here's an example of the SDK being used to retrieve all lists in an account:

```python
import ET_Client
client = ET_Client.ET_Client(False, False)
request = ET_Client.ET_List()
request.auth_stub = client
response = request.get()
print response
```

This code sample highlights the pattern for interacting with objects in the Python SDK. First, you instantiate an <samp class="codeph nolang">ET_Client</samp> object. Then, you instantiate an object of the type you want to work with, in this example <samp class="codeph nolang">ET_List</samp>. Then, you specify account context (the <samp class="codeph nolang">ET_Client</samp> instance) for the operation using the <samp class="codeph nolang">authStub</samp> property. Finally, you perform a REST-style operation on the object: <samp class="codeph nolang">get</samp> (retrieve), <samp class="codeph nolang">post</samp> (create), <samp class="codeph nolang">patch</samp> (update), or <samp class="codeph nolang">delete</samp>.
