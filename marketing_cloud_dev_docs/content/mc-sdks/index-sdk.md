title: Introduction to Marketing Cloud Platform SDKs
---

> This documentation applies to the Marketing Cloud platform SDKs. For MobilePush SDKs, review [MobilePush SDKs](mobile-push-sdk.htm). For the Content Builder SDK, review [Extend Content Builder](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.noversion.mc-app-development.meta/mc-app-development/content-sdk.htm).

The Marketing Cloud platform SDKs provide a cross-functional framework around the SOAP and REST APIs. This framework allows developers to integrate APIs using native language code libraries. The platform SDKs use both the SOAP and REST APIs to provide agnostic protocol interfaces and automated token management.

We currently offer six platform SDKs.

* [C# SDK](getting-started-with-the-csharp-sdk.htm)
* [Java SDK](getting-started-with-the-java-sdk.htm)
* [Node SDK](https://github.com/salesforce-marketingcloud/FuelSDK-Node)
* [PHP SDK](getting-started-with-the-php-sdk.htm)
* [Ruby SDK](getting-started-with-the-ruby-sdk.htm)
* [Python SDK](getting-started-with-the-python-sdk.htm)

We also provide SDKs for iOS and Android to use with MobilePush.
