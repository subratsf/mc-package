title: Notification Signing
---

Marketing Cloud Event Notification Service signs every notification delivered to your callback with an HMAC-SHA256 signature. The signature is produced by signing the entire notification payload using a signature key unique to the callback. You receive the signature key when you create the callback.

> You can retrieve a callbackâ€™s signature key only during callback creation. Be sure to save the signature key for future use.

To validate the authenticity of a notification, use the callback signature key to create an HMAC-SHA256 signature of the notification payload received. Then compare the HMAC-SHA256 signature to the value in <samp class="codeph nolang">x-sfmc-ens-signature</samp>. If the values match, you know that the source of the notification is Marketing Cloud.
