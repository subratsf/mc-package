title: Channels
---

Channels are virtual separations of use cases for your marketing content. They typically correspond to a different internal app, or a different partner, even though partners with separate use cases could have multiple channels. For example, Email Studio has the "email" channel and a web app could have the "web" channel.

An asset can be restricted to one or some channels and can hold different content for different channels using views.

Add channel restrictions to the asset as an object, using the <samp class="codeph nolang">channels</samp> attribute.
