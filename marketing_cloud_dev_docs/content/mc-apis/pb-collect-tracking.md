title: Einstein Recommendation Collect Tracking API
---
##Overview
Einstein Recommendation Collect Tracking calls are available to be implemented with a server side option.  To use these implementation methods, make an HTTP POST call to the appropriate URL, with the corresponding payload parameter values.  

In order to manage session and user values you will need to send user_id and session_id on the same node level as the payload.  On the first call, you don't need to pass these values and they are returned in the JSON response.

See the parameter definitions and example URLs below.

<div class="alert">NOTE: All calls must be sent with Content-Type: application/json.</div>

Below is a sample of the minimum requirement to implement an observation script, also referred to as “Collect".
