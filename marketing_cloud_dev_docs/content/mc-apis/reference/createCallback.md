##Usage

> Your URL endpoint must be online and reachable before you create a callback. The Event Notification Service immediately attempts to post verification details to the endpoint.

If your callback doesnâ€™t respond within 30 seconds or returns a non-200 HTTP status, the callback creation fails with a 400 HTTP status and the reason for the failure similar to the following.

```
"MCMS_UWH_Runtime_GeneralFailure_probeCallbackLiveness: CallbackId is 08b67f0e-5be8-4673-97e9-682c133f778c. Could not verify callback url `'https://example.com'`. Please test that the url is reachable with a https POST call and returns a 200 http status code. To retry please delete the callback and create it again. Status: NameResolutionFailure. The remote name could not be resolved: 'example.com'"
```
