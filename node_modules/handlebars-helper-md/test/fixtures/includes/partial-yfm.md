---
title: This title is from the partial YFM (partial-yfm.hbs)
---
<article id="partial-yfm">
  <h1 class="title">
    {{title}}
  </h1>
  <p class="description"> {{description}} </p>
</article>

In this example, the context for `title` should be from the YAML front matter of `partial-yfm.hbs`,
but since no `description` property exists in the YFM of the markdown file, the context for `description`
should come from the inheriting page.

## Example HTML

> Below this line is HTML converted from Markdown

## Headings

Headings from `h1` through `h6` are constructed with a `#` for each level:

``` markdown
# h1 Heading
## h2 Heading
### h3 Heading
#### h4 Heading
##### h5 Heading
###### h6 Heading
```

Renders to:

# h1 Heading
## h2 Heading
### h3 Heading
#### h4 Heading
##### h5 Heading
###### h6 Heading

HTML:

``` html
<h1>h1 Heading</h1>
<h2>h2 Heading</h2>
<h3>h3 Heading</h3>
<h4>h4 Heading</h4>
<h5>h5 Heading</h5>
<h6>h6 Heading</h6>
```

## Tables
Tables are created by adding pipes as dividers between each cell, and by adding a line of dashes (also separated by bars) beneath the header. Note that the pipes do not need to be vertically aligned.


``` markdown
| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| data   | path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. |
| engine | engine to be used for processing templates. Handlebars is the default. |
| ext    | extension to be used for dest files. |
```

Renders to:

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| data   | path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. |
| engine | engine to be used for processing templates. Handlebars is the default. |
| ext    | extension to be used for dest files. |

And this HTML:

``` html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Option</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>data</td>
    <td>path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>engine</td>
    <td>engine to be used for processing templates. Handlebars is the default.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ext</td>
    <td>extension to be used for dest files.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

### Right aligned text

Adding a colon on the right side of the dashes below any heading will right align text for that column.

``` markdown
| Option | Description |
| ------:| -----------:|
| data   | path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. |
| engine | engine to be used for processing templates. Handlebars is the default. |

```
